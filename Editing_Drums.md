# No one is perfect so we may need to edit our drum track. 
In this section we will learn:
1. What our time selection is/ recorded area
2. How to edit individual drum hits on the timeline
3. How to split drum tracks
4. How to get drum track ready for looping

## 1. What our time selection is/ recorded area
After recording your drum track you should see something that looks like the picture below:

The circled area is the recording and it is within a time and space in your timeline. As our default time signature is 4/4 you have 4 beats in a measure at 120 beats per minute. This is quite typical. Now not everything will be aligned with the verticle lines that indicate beats in a measure. So what we need to do is edit them. 

## 2. Editing individual drum hits
Double click on the grey area with your midi notes. This will open a new window and show a bunch of red and oragne squares that indicate your played notes. We want them to be triangles so at the top of the page select the triangle button shown below.

Switching the midi notes to triangles makes it easier to edit the individual drum hits on the timeline. Now we need to move some of our hits. To do that just click on an individual hit and then drag it to where you want it to be in the measure. If you missed a beat just double click and a beat will be placed where you click. Make sure these hits are aligned with either the snare drum or kick drum lines shown on the left side of the page.

Do this for about four measures, keeping a consistent pattern for your beat.

## Spliting tracks
You may have recorded to long for this tutorial (over four measures) so to delete the excess just click at the end of the first measure on the drum track in your normal view, having left the note editor, and then press *s* to split the track. Select the leftovers on the right and press delete. You should now have four measure of track.

## Looping
Now to get our track ready to record piano we should loop the drum track. To do this click at the start of the timeline and drag to the end of the fourth measure of drums. After that click on the loop button shown below. This will, upon playback, on play this recorded section making it easier to come up with ideas on what the piano should be doing.

Great! Now you are ready to record your keys!!
