# First Steps
Congratulations on getting Reaper set up. That can take a while so pat your self on the back for getting this far!
## The First Step
Our first step before we record anything is to get sounds for both our drum track and our midi piano.
The virtual studio technology (or VST) I will be using for our piano sound is [Keys of the 70's](https://www.lostin70s.com/download)
This has great sounds for our midi piano and is what I will be using. I enjoy the Wurlitzer sound and am a big fan of Supertramp so that makes sense. I will lead you on how to actually download and install this software as it can be confusing. Also the site looks sketch but it is totally safe. The downloads take a bit of time though, but we will make it through that. 

## Second Step
Let us now get our drum sounds for this recording. I use this [website](https://samples.kb6.de/downloads.php#att) that contains many free drum machine samples. For the purposes of this tutorial we will download the Linn-LM1 #167 on the page.
