# Time to record your keys.
The *key* to this section is to practice what you want to play over your drums. Maybe the drums and the piano align, maybe there is give and take, I am not sure. The creative part is up to you just spend time with the loop and have fun with it.

## How to record keys
This is relativley simple as we have already recorded drums and recording keys is much like that as well. So essentially we need to disarm the drum track. Once that is done, rearm the piano track. Play around a bit with the loop. I would say the metronome is not too necessary for this one as the piano for our purposes will be providing the melody and harmony as opposed to rhythm which is the drums job. So once you feel confident press record and start playing the loop will continue until you stop the recording or press space bar and this will give up multiple takes. You can do as many takes as you like. I have done up to 28 one time.
