2.How to shift midi notes and lengths

## Midi editor keys edition
First you need to sleect which take you would like to edit. Select the best one. Then double click it a la the drum track editing.

Now the notes should look like the drum notes but we do not want that (If they don't you can skip this step) so select the squar note section at the top of the editor menu.

They should now look something like this.

## Shifiting lengths/ time
So say that your notes are not aligned with how you wanted them to be. That is an easy fix just select the note and the drag them to their correct time and space in the editor. Also if you need to change lengths as I know for me sometimes the length of a note is just a bit over the start of a beat you can take your cursor up to the edge of the note and it should change into a bracket shape. Once you have that shape click and drag to either side to make it shorter or longer. You can also change the velocity (how hard the keys are hit by draging up or down the bars at the bottom of the editor. Shown below.
