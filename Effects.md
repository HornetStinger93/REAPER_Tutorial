# Effects

Now that we have our drums and piano recorded and editited we can apply effects to our sound.
For this tutorial we will be doing a basic modulating low pass filter on our piano.
We will learn:

1. How to add EQ
2. How to create a shifting EQ
3. How to edit the shifting EQ

## Adding EQ
Eq is just editing the frequencies that are boosted or limited in a given track or track as a whole. To add eq we need to open the *FX* page for our piano track. Once open click *add*

Then go to the EQ bar and select ReaEQ Cockos.

Once open select from the drop down type menu: *Low Pass*

## Shifting EQ
You can now close the FX tabs.
With those closed now look at your Piano track fader at the bottom of the Reaper workspace and select the button called *trim*

This will open a new page. From there select the first box on the line titled *Freq Low-Pass 1* this will arm and make visible our EQ that we setup earlier on our track page. What this does is it cuts out the higher frequencies giving us only lower frequencies until it shifts and allows the higher ones through.

It should look something like this.

## Editing

To edit the purple line, right click on an area you would like to add a modifiable point and click *create new point*.

With this point you can edit if it is high or low. The higher your point the more higher frequencies will be let through and the lower the less higher frequencies will be let through. I set mine up to have a peak in the middle and then level out at the ends and beginnings. Shown below:
