# File Setup
As you now have both the drum samples and keys vst downloaded we now need to get these files to where they are accessible in Reaper.
This is not too difficult but I have included pictures to help you along.
1. First we will start with the drum samples as they are the easiest. All you need to do is extract the zipfile with the samples inside to some directory and folder where you will be able to find it later. I put mine in a folder named *samples*.
2. We need to extract Keys of the 70s. 
  The extraction method for keys of the 70s also works for most other VSTs. Although if you use this and have proplems with another VST try looking up another tutorial with that specific VST as some are more complicated than others.
  - Extratc the .dll file from the zip to a folder
