# File Setup
As you now have both the drum samples and keys vst downloaded we now need to get these files to where they are accessible in Reaper.
This is not too difficult but I have included pictures to help you along.
1. First we will start with the drum samples as they are the easiest. All you need to do is extract the zipfile with the samples inside to some directory and folder where you will be able to find it later. I put mine in a folder named *samples*.
2. We need to extract Keys of the 70s. 
  The extraction method for keys of the 70s also works for most other VSTs. Although if you use this and have proplems with another VST try looking up another tutorial with that specific VST as some are more complicated than others.
  - Extratc the .dll file from the zip to a new folder that you have created in your VSTplugins folder. The directory for the VSTplugins folder should be something like C:\Program Files (x86)\VSTplugins. I am using a different directory as that is what works for me (in the pictures) but be sure to unpack it to a new folder in this directory. I named mine "*70s*". 
  - Next, once the .dll file has been extracted to your folder in VSTplugins, extract the sound samples that you got from the website to the same folder. So you should have another folder now extracted into your new folder called RKsamples. This houses all of the samples we will be using with the VST. If you get stuck at any point in this or if this is not useful there is another tutorial on the Keys of the 70s website. 
Pictures that go with the above explaination.
